# Saleor -more interactive 

This repository contains a legacy version of Saleor with its former Storefront 1.0 and Dashboard 1.0 (Django views and HTML templates).

Additional, I implemented several features in this repository.
  - Recommended system
  - Zomm image
  - Quick-view image
  - Share to Social Media
  - Wish List
